        <h2><i class="fa fa-file-text" style="font-size:24px"></i> Financial Documents </h2><br><br>


  <p>

    Financial documents are vital tools for analysing the success of a business. If everything is going well, founders will be asked for their financial documents. These should cover a few aspects of the business, from the revenue forecasts to the operational expenses to the company’s cash flow.<br>
    
    The complexity of these documents can range from a single slide in your pitch deck showing some baseline guesses on where revenues will come from, to highly complicated Excel document that involve macros and formulas changing outcomes based on key assumptions and scenarios.<br><br>
    For general purposes you’ll need to cover at least a few aspects of your financial picture.<br><br>
    
    Every meeting with an investor will eventually always boil down to the numbers of the business, where a lot of founders struggle to accurately showcase what their plans for the business are and where they see it going.<br>
    
    It is a must to be accurate in these documents and to highlight key figures and showcase what is really important. Investors can find the smallest of flaws or inaccuracies and that could be the reason of a deal going wrong. If you’ve never done it before and you’re a first-time entrepreneur, it can be incredibly overwhelming to come up with numbers precisely. We at ExMyB consist of a team of professionals dedicated to serve new startups in setting up the business in these fund-raising related services. We have worked with over 80 clients to help them with their financials. The experience includes working with client requirements and varied across IMs, business reports, elevator pitch and pitch decks.</p>
